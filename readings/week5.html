        <p>In <em>Computer Lib / Dream Machines</em>, Ted Nelson writes of how the student should be allowed to control their own learning environment rather than rigid subject divisions being enforced by teachers. Moreover, in “Lo and Behold”, Nelson says that his vision for the Internet was a changing system of relationships in the digital world which represented the interconnectivity existing in the physical world. Using both of these concepts, the <strong>Network Culture</strong> portion of this class would allow the students to discover for themselves how the different aspects of internet history are interwoven with one another.

        In <em>Hyperland</em>, the user is presented with various ‘Micons’ that pop up when relevant information is present. A flaw to this system is that often it encourages ending videos too early and not staying to glean the full extent of knowledge offered. I would streamline this system: first, the students receive an introductory blurb on that week’s period of internet history. Each week, the period would advance, sometimes by just one year for the periods of highest development, or perhaps increments of two or five for less eventful periods. The periods would begin from the early conceptualizing of the web in the 1960s. Even if this was long before the first personal computers, the brilliance and innovation of Internet pioneers such as Douglas Egelbart and his “Mother of All Demos” will serve as excellent inspiration for students to continue that path of innovating as they begin to make their own contributions to network culture by building their own websites.

        After the initial presentation, students would be presented with a choice between several different points of view to explore. For instance, the social, bureaucratic, political and technical viewpoints seen in the first reading could be offered. Then,  students choose which point of view they would like to explore in depth. Perhaps there would be an in class activity where students can browse old websites and readings to discover the information for themselves in groups.

        The first few sessions of the <strong>Creative Computing</strong> portion of the class would have to consist of basic tutorials in the fundamentals of HTML and CSS. This would ensure that everyone has the same base foundation. Following the first sessions, the students would gain access to an interactive host website onto which everyone can upload their own personal websites created for the class. Students would also be able to have a look at and comment on other students’ work, reminiscent of the spirit of the early web where the Internet was a community. Each student will take a natural affinity to exploring different things on their own while creating their website. This way, students can learn from one another rather than everyone learning only from the teacher.
