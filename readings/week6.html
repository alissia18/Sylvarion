            Assuming that I have the option to do so, I would leave my position in order
            to preserve my morals. As a corporate executive, I do not want to profit from
            students’ innovation, seeing as this perpetuates the false idea that ideas are
            a property that can be bought and sold as seen in <em>Everything is a Remix. </em>
            Moreover, software is a club good: if one person uses software, this does not 
            deplete the software supply for everyone else, so it is a non-rival good. 
            However, access to software is restricted when we must pay for it, so it is an 
            exclusive good. I believe club goods should not exist; since these are not 
            limited resources, forcing people to pay for them is rather pointless and only 
            benefits those in power.

            I would much rather implement something like the programmer’s tax described in 
            <em>The GNU Manifesto</em>, in which people would choose between paying a fixed 
            sum which would fund the general pool of developers, or donating to a specific
            developer whose software they are interested in using and obtaining tax credit.
            Public funding would encourage collaboration amongst users and programmers
            alike rather than promoting exclusivity and competition.

            Assuming that I am being forced to retain my position against my will, and not
            even offered the sweet release of death, this is what I would do:
        </p>
        <p>
            I would offer attached scholarships at the school: students would have partial
            or full coverage of expenses during their studies provided they work for a few
            years at Omnicorp after graduation. This way, the students’ custom software 
            will bring in the profits Omnicorp’s shareholders are looking for. At Omnicorp,
            I would allow the students working for the company to keep their free software
            license with GNU because proprietary software takes freedom away from users, 
            thereby discouraging collaboration and innovation amongst programmers. We could
            distribute their software at a price, since free software does not mean free of 
            charge: it means those who have it are free to modify and redistribute it. 
        </p>
        <p>
            The redistribution itself would have no cost attached to it. In his 
            “Open Letter to Hobbyists”, Bill Gates complains that hobbyists’ redistribution
            of software at no cost is “theft”, but this is false because labeling it as 
            “theft” implies that programmers copying software is stealing a valuable
            commodity free of charge. In contrast, as seen in the <em>The GNU Manifesto</em>,
            copying a program is as natural to a programmer as breathing is to a person; 
            it would be illogical to view air as a valuable commodity. This idea is further 
            shown in <em>Everything is a Remix</em>, which states the fundamental steps of 
            evolution as: copy, transform and combine. Copying is the first step to evolving, 
            and to prevent or restrict a society from evolving is unnatural.
