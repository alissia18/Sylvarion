        Technology could solve many problems if it were used differently. For instance, many developing countries don’t have access to breakthrough medical treatments such as the COVID vaccine. This causes the pandemic to never end since someone is always spreading COVID. This problem isn’t solved because poorer countries cannot afford to pay the steep price set by vaccine making corporations.

        Another problem that could be solved with technology is lack of knowledge of the law: if the law were available in comprehensible form online, free of intense legal jargon, there would be fewer instances of people accidentally committing crimes because they did not know their actions were against the law. The government pretends to make the law accessible by posting its documents, but does not really simplify the terms for easier understanding because they want to be able to prosecute more people. Judges and lawyers get paid more the more cases they undertake. It’s far easier to convict people who are unaware of their rights.

        This problem with the law extends to all education: if information were more freely available on the Internet rather than locked behind paid databases, more people would be educated, thus solving the problem of the majority of the population being blind to the world. I do not mean going to school, I mean being aware of the world around us. For instance, I went to school but until this class I barely understood the difference between liberal and conservative worldviews. This is once again unsolved due to money: by locking education behind heavy jargon and paywalls, governments are breeding generations of mindless workers who learn from childhood to obey, conform and listen, stunting their creative and critical thinking skills as soon as possible.

        In general, in our society, proposed digital engineering or creative tech projects are evaluated based on how much capital they will generate. Typically, a project is deemed not worth it if it does not seem to appeal to the market. This is a poor form of evaluation because it has led to the development of shallow digital projects such as Instagram, Meta, TikTok, etc. These programs pretend to have a social appeal, but in reality, they are destroying society. They promote conformity, stifling the creativity of the general population. Moreover, the general population is so used to confirming that making an Instagram or TikTok account is only natural; most people are not even aware that in the early days of the web they could’ve had infinite customization on their websites. As such, these projects earn extremely large amounts of capital thanks to advertisements on them and the high amount of users they have.

        I believe projects should not be evaluated based on how much they contribute to the economy; instead,  they should be evaluated based on how much they contribute culturally to society. For instance, there could be polls distributed to the public, perhaps online, so that people could vote for software projects which they find useful to them. Moreover, the creators of these projects would focus on publicizing the benefits their projects will have on solving problems in society rather than improving the economy. The general population should be given back its freedom of speech and should have a say in what programs are created for their use.
