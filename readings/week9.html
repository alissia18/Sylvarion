        I would refuse the sponsorship regardless of how much money it is. As an influencer, it's my job to curate my brand to match my core beliefs and values. As such, I will not take any part in helping Pepsi earn more money. I do not want to be known for helping the company who makes insensitive ads such as the infamous protest one posted in the "Extra" section of this week's readings. I do not want any part in the corporate-funded modern internet of the present.

        In fact, accepting this offer from Pepsi would negate everything I stand for as an influencer. Corporations are associated with and are the product of individualism: every person for themselves. On the contrary, I would have built a collective community space to engage with my audience. To endorse Pepsi is to reject the core value of my career.

        If I were an influencer, my website would be a home for my audience much like the websites of the early Internet because I would want to portray myself as a human interacting with other humans, not a mindless corporate zombie. If my audience doesn't like it, they can leave. I'm not even interested in being an influencer - the initial amount of fame described in the reading question is already more than I'd want. If it was between supporting a corporation which is completely insensitive to social issues or changing careers, I would change careers.
