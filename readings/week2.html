    <h2>Week Two
        <p>Internet History</p>
    </h2>
    <div class="answer">
    <p>If I could change the history of the Internet in any way, I would prevent the internet from becoming commercialised. I agree with the 
    ‘hacker mentality’ from the story, in which computer scientists and enthusiasts 
     believed that all information should be free to be shared among the whole world.</p>
     
    <p>To achieve this, computer science and software development would have to be 
        funded by the government as a public service. ARPANET becoming readily 
        available for public use, after many years of remaining a military-exclusive 
        resource, was a step forward during the closed world of the Cold War. In 
        contrast, Bill Gates’ desire to privatise the Internet was a step backwards 
        in history, stemming from the rise of corporate capitalism. Access to the 
        Internet went from being restricted by the government, to being public, to 
        being restricted once more by money, ending up more limited and dangerous 
        than it initially was. </p>
        
    <p>To maintain the Internet as a public service, I would need funding from the government in the same way Canada has free healthcare and lower university tuition thanks to government subsidies. During the era of the ARPANET, the government was eager to fund the development of the Internet since it was used exclusively for creating software that enhanced war tactics against countries falsely labelled as communist such as the USSR and Vietnam. For instance, Igloo White was a program designed to detect minute details of daily life in an area in Vietnam to allow for accurate bomb deployment. However, once the Internet reached the general public and the military had relinquished its control, obtaining funding from the government to maintain the Internet as a public service, rather than a private one, would have become much more difficult. During the 1970s, the United States was plagued by the Red Scare, a social era in which nearly anything based around sharing resources and services amongst groups of people without demanding monetary payment would have been labelled as communist. The Internet, had it not become privatised so soon after the military had released it to the public, would have been labelled as communist as well. As such, it is highly unlikely that the North American governments at the time would have funded a service that would benefit the development and spread of information for the masses. </p>
    <p>Alternatively, I could turn to hacker societies such as Community Memory for funding. However, this would be a high-risk endeavour, since I and the other members of the community would risk being imprisoned due to paranoia during the Red Scare. </p>
    <p>The Great Man Theory states that those with the qualifications to lead and hold power have those qualifications since birth; these traits are not learned. Also, great leaders will rise to power when they are needed [<a href="https://www.managementstudyguide.com/great-man-theory.htm">source</a>]. The analysis in the preceding paragraphs seems to support this theory, as it is a self-fulfilling prophecy: those who believe themselves to be great men rise to power, and those who do not shall not attempt to. If I believed myself to be a great leader, I could attempt to gather funding from hacker organisations despite the risks; if I didn’t, I would not attempt to. Unfortunately, being a woman would greatly lessen my chance of having an impact on history. This is shown in the reading as well, since it focuses almost uniquely on great male leaders who participated in the Internet’s development. Since the 1970s were a period of great development for technology and the Internet, the government was eager to offer funding at first, and later privatisation offered significant monetary gain. Those who believed themselves capable of becoming great leaders took the opportunity to champion the advancement of the Internet. Bill Gates was one of these men, and he championed the internet’s conversion to a capitalist service, ushering in the era where independent developers would create their own software for the Internet to make money. </p>
    <p>History should not be defined by great men alone; the reality is likely that there were many other contributors whose additions were erased. However, as evidenced by the reading’s focus on male leaders, this theory is so deeply grounded in history that going against it, as a woman trying to make a service public in a capitalist world, seems unlikely to yield success.</p>
