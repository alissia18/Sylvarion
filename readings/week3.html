    <h2>Week Three
        <p>Global Networks</p>

    <div class="answer">
        <p>The first step in creating a new network is creating new infrastructure. Most Western startup companies will opt for creating factories. The ability to train employees minimally allows corporations to pay them very little, thereby maximising profits. However, this system is highly unethical because it creates oppressive and unbearable working conditions. For instance, in 2010, FoxConn factories in Taiwan had 14 successful suicide attempts from workers jumping off the roof of the building. At the time of the article about the smartphone app, there had already been 4 more suicides in 2011.</p>
        <p>I believe technology should be created with the intent of building community and sharing resources and information. I do not want to create an environment where workers are so miserable that they wish to end their lives, so I will instead develop a workplace similar to guilds. Dating back to the era before the Industrial Revolution, in guilds, masters of the craft would train groups of apprentices who make up most of the production line. They work until they gather enough expertise and training to become masters of their own right. In doing so, they gain permits and can run their own shops and train new sets of apprentices, further developing the industry.</p>
        <p>To modernise this concept, I would take inspiration from a local initiative: Sandbox Technology at the Concordia Library. Sandbox puts out calls for volunteers. The employees – usually Concordia work-study students – will teach the volunteers various skills such as 3D printing, sewing, knitting, 3D scanning and Virtual Reality, so that the volunteers can then help out by teaching other visitors those skills when they visit the workshop. Since I am hired by the government, I would have the funds to monetize this process: I would offer people training and then employ them at my guilds, then have the most experienced people teach others in turn.</p>
        <p>Over time, my company would gain a good reputation since I would focus on quality, not quantity, meaning its products would be long lasting and made without planned obsolescence. The point of guilds is to create good products, not to make excessive profits. I am sure the clientele of North Turtle Island would appreciate the higher quality of such products compared to those of the big companies of the South.</p>
        <p>Despite the focus on longevity, there will inevitably be some electronic waste. There shall be a built in recycling facility in the company to avoid any incentive to illegally ship away used electronics to impoverished countries such as Ghana. I will invest some of the funds from the government into developing proper recycling and disposal facilities because these processes can be quite costly. Moreover, some job opportunities can be created by creating guilds specialised in repurposing old electronics, taking them apart and putting them together again to create new products which can be sold once more. In Ghana, 10,000 people are employed this way, so a similar initiative would likely work in North Turtle Island as well.</p>
        <p>To ensure that everyone can access the Internet, I would create hubs at community centres like the Detroit Free Mesh Network Project did. From there, connections could be built to neighbouring houses. I would use the ‘mesh network’ style in which each infrastructure device is connected to as many other devices as possible to create a consistent internet connection within the community that has fewer single points of failure. In traditional Wi-Fi, there is a single access point through which all traffic must pass, which makes the overall Internet connection weaker and less consistent. <a href="https://www.techtarget.com/iotagenda/definition/mesh-network-topology-mesh-network">[source]</a></p>
        <p>I agree with the notions of technological sovereignty presented in the article about TCCN. As such, I would create a new network independent from the neighbouring South country. Like TCCN, this network would develop based on the interests of the country rather than turn its users’ information into a commodity. This way, the principles of sharing and community would be preserved over the capitalist ideology that monetization is the only form of progression. Overall, my network infrastructure would be designed with the purpose of giving everyone in the community equal access to the Internet while creating job opportunities which require detailed training and offer fair wages accordingly. Communication is a fundamental human right, and my project has the goal of preserving this right at its core.</p>
