        Yes, I would help the scientists distribute the vaccine around the world once it 
        is confirmed safe. However, this will not be an easy battle: since capitalism
        reigns supreme currently, the side with the most money almost always wins the 
        fight. This does not mean it is impossible: Aaron Swartz and Demand Progress 
        managed to stop SOPA (Stop Online Piracy Act)’s passage through congress, and 
        I believe I could take inspiration from his methodology. Yes, I help them. 
        First, I would suggest to the scientists that we form an online group committed
        to making vaccines available worldwide to abolish the pandemic once and for 
        all, similar to how Aaron founded Demand Progress. Then I would suggest that
        everyone contact as many other research scientists as they know and pitch
        the project to them as well, so that we could get more traction all around
        the world. I would then convince the scientists to share the vaccine formulas
        with the online group so that they can start producing the vaccines in their
        own countries.

        Once we had our own vaccine in production, I would start forming petitions 
        and extending the outreach to the general public announcing that we have the
        vaccine cheaply available. In doing all of this, mine and the scientists’ 
        goal would not be to make money. It would be to make the world a better place
        and I think we can all agree that eradicating COVID would do just that.
        Through public outreach such as rallies, posters and blog posts, we could 
        convince the general public to boycott Omnicorp’s vaccine. We wouldn’t have to 
        worry about shipping as much either because we have representation in research
        facilities around the world.

        This is a dangerous endeavour and we may be in danger of being prosecuted by 
        federal law enforcement; because of his moves to make information public, Aaron
        Swartz was facing 13 felonies. However, they did amend the article which was the
        basis for most of those felonies after his death, so it’s likely that we wouldn’t
        be in as much danger as he was. This cause is more than worth the risk; succeeding
        at free vaccine distribution would be a victory for the entire world.
