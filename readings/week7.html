        If this were to happen, I would be disappointed, but not surprised. Sadly, the 
        gender wage gap is a commonality in the workplace. Still, holding concrete 
        evidence in my hands would give me the courage to try and make a change in the 
        company.

        First, I would go to other coworkers and show them the paper. Generally these 
        claims will be taken more seriously when made by a group than as an individual. 
        Ideally, I would get some men on my side too as men are generally taken more 
        seriously than women. In the perfect world where men would agree to help me take 
        action against this injustice, we would then work together to collect more evidence
        before bringing the case to our higher-ups. Of course, I would be asking the 
        higher-ups to equalize the wage gap between men and women doing the same job. 
        Sadly, there is a high chance my boss or even my male coworkers would dismiss me 
        as being too dramatic or pushy, as discussed in “The Dads of Tech”. Clay Shirky 
        thinks women simply aren’t willing to self-promote but the reality is that when 
        we try to, we get dismissed for being too emotional. I believe this is because the 
        men who own the tech industry have not changed their beliefs about women in 
        programming. As stated in <em>On Software, or the Persistence of Visual Knowledge</em>,
        the ideal vision of programming in the early days was a man calling out commands to 
        a female operator.

        The men in charge of the tech industry tend to dismiss women’s role in technological
        development but, as stated in <em>On Software, or the Persistence of Visual Knowledge</em>, 
        women were “the simulators, assemblers and programmers” of early computers. Technology 
        would not be where it is today without its female operators, but for some reason, men 
        are inclined to ignore this history and treat female programmers as nothing more than 
        mindless machines, as was done to the Wrens – female programmer volunteers from the
        Women’s Royal Naval Service – in the past. I wish I could say I believed in my chances 
        of earning equal pay for women and men, but the reality is that my claim would likely 
        be ignored by my boss and nothing would change.
