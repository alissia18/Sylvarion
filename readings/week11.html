    <h2>Week Eleven
        <p>Online Advertising and Privacy</p>

        Yes, advertising does work on me. For instance, trailers have done an excellent job of getting me to watch movies, TV shows and even play video games. When determining whether or not I am interested in one of those, I would typically seek out the trailer myself. However, advertising alone isn’t enough: for instance, even the best movie trailer could never incentivise me to watch a horror movie or a heavily gory movie. I am simply not interested in these genres. Besides advertisement and mass media, tastes also come from personal experience and innate tastes. I have always been terrified of horror movies but a lot of my friends love them. I can’t quite place where that taste comes from. I’ve always had a preference for fantasy, so fantasy trailers are a lot more effective on me.

        After reading this week’s assigned articles I have realized that I am a lot less free than I thought I was. The Canadian army advertisement actually scared me when I watched it. There may be surveillance everywhere on the internet, even in the very programs which claim to protect our privacy with security measures, according to the article about BBG.

        I believe that societies and governments are trapping the world into a state of obedience, where we breed mindless workers to go to their mundane jobs and earn money so they can buy the best material comforts advertised to them and then work more to support their expenses, and so on. I am not free. I could sit in this class criticizing capitalism but at the end of the day I am still going to be stuck succumbing to the system to get a job so that I can survive.
