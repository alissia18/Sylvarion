            In the early days of the Internet, the online community was encouraging and welcoming; many web pages of this era were created to be homes for amateur web designers. They did not strive for clickbait or attention grabbing; they were sincere and showed the personality of their creators. I believe this attitude carried through artists who made net art; much like the personal websites, the examples discussed in Rachel Greene’s reading focus less on aesthetics and more on storytelling and interactivity. Artists of the era were likely eager to experiment with the new, freeing medium of web design.

            Success as an artist is defined by the ability to communicate a narrative through the artwork, whether that is the stable, classical thought-provoking narratives of paintings past or adaptable narratives in modern net.art. Successful art pieces require multiple glances or, in the case of net.art, substantial amounts of exploring the web page to be fully appreciated.

            <em>Ways of Seeing</em> says that in the past, everything around the painting was part of its meaning, but now, paintings can be viewed in all kinds of contexts thanks to reproduction. This is a positive change: it means art has acquired infinitely more dimension and meaning. To each person, depending on the context where the art is viewed, the work can mean something entirely different. This means each viewer can connect deeper with the artwork and make connections to their personal lives and experiences. The beauty of net.art is that this form is designed specifically to be adapted to each viewer, since according to Rachel Greene, these pieces focus more on interactivity and links than on pure aesthetics.

            “Brandon” was an extremely successful piece of net.art. I love the way it begins with the squares flashing pictures related to Brandon as the cursor is moved across the screen before progressing to a rushing timeline consisting of snapshots of Brandon’s life. There are several clickable links which appear as the timeline scrolls up and down the page. Notably, there was a testimony from someone named Fiona and a mixup of cruelty-laden sentences which hinted at Brandon’s troubled life. Following this was a Google search with Brandon’s name. After having experienced glimpses of his life, at last, I was brought to the full story. After having read through it all, I stared blankly at my computer screen for several minutes, because that was the extent to which the site impacted me. This is a perfect example of an unraveling narrative which reveals itself slowly the longer one spends looking at the website.

            I also enjoyed exploring “My Boyfriend Came Back From the War”. The black and white images and simple lines of text created a melancholic ambiance. Also, since the text was vague and nondescript, it seemed to invite the viewer to fill in their own blanks to the narrative. It adds a sense of timelessness to the piece; with a nondescript romance and a nondescript war, this website will be a relevant experience no matter when in time it is used.

            In contrast, many websites created for mainstream audiences are artistic failures. With their flat, lifeless designs, there is little to no presence of narrative. The vibrant culture of net.art is sadly disappearing, but I hope the energy of the ‘90s and the sense of community of that era will be resurrected thanks to the ongoing movements supporting the preservation of the websites of the early Internet.

            This site is based on images from Google Maps. As you move your cursor around the site, different collaged images are shown of satellite images. It creates the sensation of an ethereal journey through both space and time.
