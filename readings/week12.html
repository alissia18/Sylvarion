    <h2>Week Twelve

        According to the article in this week’s readings, tech companies have the power and the resources to potentially install surveillance software on the computers of their employees. This is highly unethical but I suppose in the place of those tech CEOs, I would not care. This surveillance software would help me identify which workers are involved. 
      <p>
        I could then make a global announcement to the company and maybe also to the public reassuring them how diverse we are and reiterate that because we are so open minded any move made to contradict our ways such as union forming would put the employees implicated in danger of losing their jobs or even criminal pursuit. As seen in the article, large companies can frame union formation as criminal thanks to the power they hold, and because they present their image as a ‘forward-thinking-business’.
      </p>

      <p>
        If this doesn’t work and they follow through with the union anyway, then I already have the list of people to fire from the surveillance software. Also, this surveillance software could allow me to gather evidence and mount a case against them. All of this is terribly unethical and I am the criminal one, not them, but in the position of the large corporation, I wouldn’t care. Moreover, if I have to fire those people then I can minimize the credit I give them for their work on web design, and give more credit to my more complacent employees. This would show that falling in line is rewarded while stepping out of line warrants punishment.
